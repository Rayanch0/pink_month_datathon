      This project involves training a machine learning model to classify breast cancer images as benign or malignant. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The final model is an ensemble of Logistic Regression and Random Forest, optimized using GridSearchCV.
      
      Code Breakdown
      Data Loading and Exploration:
      
      Load the training dataset from a CSV file.
      
      Display the first few rows and basic statistics for initial data exploration.
      
      Data Preprocessing:
      
      Encode categorical labels.
      
      Normalize features using StandardScaler.
      
      Train-Test Split:
      
      Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio).
      
      Model Selection and Training:
      
      Define Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
      
      Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
      
      Create an ensemble model using VotingClassifier with soft voting.
      
      Train the ensemble model on the training data.
      
      Model Evaluation:
      
      Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
      
      Test Data Prediction and Submission:
      
      Load the test dataset.
      
      Preprocess the test data similarly to the training data.

      This project uses deep learning to classify breast cancer images as benign or malignant. It leverages the VGG16 architecture for feature extraction, augmented by custom layers for the final classification. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
      
      Code Breakdown
      Data Loading:

      Load images from directories for benign and malignant cases.
      
      Data Preprocessing:
      
      Normalize images.
      
      Convert labels to one-hot encoding.
      
      Use ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation.
      
      Train-Test Split:
      
      Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio).
      
      Model Architecture and Training:
