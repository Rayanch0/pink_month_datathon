----------------About challenge1-----------------

This project involves training a machine learning model to classify breast cancer images as benign or malignant. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. The final model is an ensemble of Logistic Regression and Random Forest, optimized using GridSearchCV.

Code Breakdown
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the training dataset from a CSV file.

Display the first few rows and basic statistics for initial data exploration.

Data Preprocessing:

Encode categorical labels.

Normalize features using StandardScaler.

Train-Test Split:

Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio).

Model Selection and Training:

Define Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

Create an ensemble model using VotingClassifier with soft voting.

Train the ensemble model on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Test Data Prediction and Submission:

Load the test dataset.

Preprocess the test data similarly to the training data.

Make predictions on the test data.

Create a submission file with test IDs and predicted labels.
